Communication has always been an issue for deaf people. According to Deaf Development Cambodia, there are over 51000 deaf people in Khmer, but only 2000 has access education and learn sign language & fingerspelling to have a proper communicate with other. Which means other 49000 has a very limit opportunities. 

Additionally, by Krousar Thmey, an NGO, there are only 5 schools of 2 provinces in Cambodia that provide the free deaf education, which not enough yet. 

> So why not build a system that provide a free deaf education that everyone can learn from there?
